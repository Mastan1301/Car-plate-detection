# Car-plate-detection
The project is about fetching the user details from https://parivahan.gov.in/parivahan/ using number plate details.
It is actually a part of a project which involves car-plate number detection using image processing using Raspberry-Pi and a Pi-camera. The code basically collects the data from the server and loads the data in a Google-spreadsheet.
